# Dr.Doctor

## **Brief Introduction**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This a platform (website) aiming to be an assistant for doctors embedded with DL model which is designed to achieve the NLP work.
      



## **What We Want to Solve ?**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nowadays, human are so hustling that they don't have enough time to see a doctor directly even though they feel illness. Plus, training a professional doctor is quite time-consuming and the clinic's encounter may be confronted with the same time-consuming tasks. Therefore,  we try to build a platform to solve the kind of problems while solving the cost of time and labors.




## **How We Solve ?**
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The platform typically consists of three main parts — front-end, back-end and DL model.
  
- **Front-end Side**
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We use typical  HTML/CSS and Django to build the front-end views.


- **Back-end Side**
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We purely use Django to buld up the back-end .
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Back-end deals with the interaction between the users and the trained DL model which is designed to answering/diagnosing the users based on their text inputs .


- **DL Model**
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This system is designed to solve NPL problems in some extent . We want to allow users to type in the symptoms they observe on their body, and the system will give one or several diagnosis / disease names in return which lets the users get a rough picture of their illness conditions and be able to see the corresponding clinic correctly .
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; More analysis, designing and information on our model training, please see the DOCUMENTS below .
